# TripleTen_Final_Project_Bootcamp
The final project includes an A/B test, SQL tasks, and the creation of a Tableau dashboard. Within each project file, the features of each project are explained.

1. A/B Testing Project
Exercise
You have received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessors failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then abandoned it (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and test results.
### Instructions for completing the task
Describe the objectives of the study.
Explore the data:
Do types need to be converted?
Are there missing or duplicate values? If so, how would you characterize them?
Perform exploratory data analysis:
Study conversion at different stages of the funnel.
Is the number of events per user evenly distributed across samples?
Are there users who are present in both samples?
How is the number of events distributed across days?
Are there any peculiarities in the data that need to be taken into account before starting the A/B test?
Evaluate the results of the A/B test:
What can you say about the results of the A/B test?
Use a z-test to check for statistical difference between proportions.
Describe your conclusions regarding the EDA stage and the results of the A/B test.
